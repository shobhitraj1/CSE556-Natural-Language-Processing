# CSE556-Natural-Language-Processing

📘 **Course Overview:** <br>
This repository contains my coursework (assignments, &amp; semester exams) for the [Natural Language Processing](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE556) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2025. <br>
The course covers text processing, language modeling, word embeddings, sequence tagging (POS, HMM), attention, transformers and their applications (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.), with tasks including sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, dialog systems, summarization, and syntactic parsing.

📂 **Folder Structure:**
- `/Assignment 1`: Implemented WordPiece tokenizer, trained word2vec, and built a neural language model for next-word prediction.
- `/Assignment 2`: Performed Aspect Term Extraction (BIO encoding) and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using RNNs, pretrained embeddings, and fine-tuned transformer models, fine-tuned SpanBERT and SpanBERT-CRF for question answering on the SQuAD v2 dataset.
- `/Assignment 3`: Implemented a Transformer from scratch for language modeling, applied BART and T5 for claim normalization (CLAN dataset), and built a multimodal sarcasm explanation model.
- `/Quizzes`: Contains materials related to the quizzes.
- `/Midsem`: Contains materials related to the midterm examination.
- `/Endsem`: Contains materials related to the endterm examination.
- `/Project`: Coming soon.

📅 **Semester:**
6th Semester (3rd Year)
